# 🐶 TinDog  

TinDog is a fun little project — basically **Tinder for dogs**.  
It was the **third website I built** while learning web development,  
and this time I had a bit more structure since I was following Angela Yu’s course.  

---

## 📖 About
- A **responsive landing page** designed with **Bootstrap**.  
- Mimics a dating app interface — but for dogs 🐾.  
- A playful project that helped me understand **modern CSS frameworks**.  

---

## 🚀 What I Learned
- How to use **Bootstrap** for grids, layouts, and components.  
- The basics of **responsive design**.  
- How to organize a project more cleanly than my first two attempts.  
- That learning can be fun when the project itself is quirky.  

---

## ⚡ Highlights
- Mobile-friendly design thanks to Bootstrap.  
- A polished look compared to my earliest HTML/CSS projects.  
- The first time I felt like I was building something “real.”  

---

## 💡 Reflections
TinDog marks a shift in my learning: from writing raw HTML/CSS experiments  
to actually leveraging frameworks and thinking about **UI/UX**.  

It’s not original (a course project) — but it’s special because it showed me  
just how much **one course + practice** can boost your skills.

## 🔮 Next Steps
Someday I might give TinDog a backend (Node.js, Flask, etc.) and  
turn it into a **fully functional parody app**. For now,  
it stays as an important stepping stone in my coding journey.
